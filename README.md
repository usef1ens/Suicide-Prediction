# Suicide-Prediction
## Project Overview

Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among adolescents, ranked as the third leading cause amongst 15-29 year olds. Suicide can have a contagion effect: each successful suicide attempt may increase the risk factor of suicide attempts on a global scale (World Health Organization, 2025).

Suicidal tendencies can be strongly related to the individual's mental health profile, although other factors can determine the execution of this act, like impulsivity. Most mental health problems can be traced back to the individual's past, at least in the widely accepted Freudian psychoanalytic model (Cherry, 2025). 

**This study aims to investigate which of the selected upbringing factors (childhood/parental) can strongly predict the development of suicidal tendencies among adolescents, and how these effects vary across socioeconomic groups.**

This study aims to investigate which of the selected upbringing factors (childhood/parental) can strongly predict the development of suicidal tendencies among adolescents, and how these effects vary across socioeconomic groups.


## Motivation

The study aims to provide predictions based on analyzing general trends of upbringing across various socioeconomic groups, which can inform early prevention and social policies. It also aims to explore how involved these factors are in such a phenomenon.

## Data 

The types of data that I will be using are, but not limited to: survey-based datasets, datasets that track individuals throughout adolescence, suicide surveillance datasets that include other variables or indicators, social surveys of governmental/national institutions, or Kaggle. Data from those resources can be enriched to accommodate the various socioeconomic groups that the individuals are or might be coming from.
